# PythonChamberApp
> Python based app that automates measurement processes for the E3 institute at TUHH.

The app connects to the measurement chamber and a vector network analyzer (VNA) that are located in the same network as the app's host via http protocol.
Given the IP addresses and API-commands of the chamber and the VNA, the app takes inputs about the desired near-field-scan (mesh, boundaries, ..) through an UI
and controls both devices/measurement equipment in an alternating fashion to achieve an automated measurement process for a defined volume.
